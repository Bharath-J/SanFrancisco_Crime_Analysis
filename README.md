# San Francisco Crime Analysis

## Objective:
This project deals with identifying common data quality issues found in publicly available datasets.

I am using Socrata Open Data API to access the [Police Department Incident Reports: 2018 to Present](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783) dataset from data.sfgov.org
